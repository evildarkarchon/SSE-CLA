CLA SSE - Sephs Skyrim Experimental Crash Log Analyzer
-------------------------------------------------------


# Goal:
- Get an easy to read indication of the most probable cause for the crash.
- Provide a list of 1 or more possible culprints (reasons) 
- Print/Summarize original lines only once for easier debuging

----

# Reason:
- Got tired of reading crash logs and there is nothing available like that for Skyrim.
- So I decided to write one myself.

----

# Requirements:
* [Python 3.3 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59596) or [Crash Logger SSE AE VR - PDB support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818)

***Note:*** *if you are using my [Skyrim SE collection for Vortex](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/1bxi7n), you only need to make sure that python is installed.*

----

# Installation:
* Download file
* Extract to \<My Games\>\Skyrim \<Version\>\SKSE
* Make sure you have at least Python 3.3 installed on your system

----

# Usage:
* Double click on the python file.
* Double click on the generated reports.
* Fix issues
* Profit

### Important:

Depending on the security settings of your system, Windows might block access for the script (as it needs read/write access).
Be sure to give it the according permission, if required, there will be a notification right of the clock in the windows taskbar.


----

# Experimental:
- Allthough I'm able to code in multiple languages, including ability to read python, I've never actualy written in python.
- Basicly, this is my "Hello World"
