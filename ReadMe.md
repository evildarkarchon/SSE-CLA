SSE CLA - Sephrajins Skyrim Experimental Crash Log Analyzer
-----------------------------------------------------------


# Reason
- Got tired of reading crash logs and there is nothing available like that for Skyrim.
- So I decided to write one myself.



# Goal
- Get an easy to read indication of the most probable cause for the crash.
- Provide a list of 1 or more possible culprints (reasons) 
- Let users to either just show on console, and/or save as MD. (might make a HTML export function later on)


# Experimental
- Allthough I'm able to code in multiple languages, including ability to read python, I've never actualy written in python.
- Basicly, this is my "Hello World"
