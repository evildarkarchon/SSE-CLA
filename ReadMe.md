SSE CLA - Sephs Skyrim Experimental Crash Log Analyzer
-------------------------------------------------------


# Goal:
- Get an easy to read indication of the most probable cause for the crash.
- Provide a list of 1 or more possible culprints (reasons) 
- Let users to either just show on console, and/or save as MD. (might make a HTML export function later on)

- So I decided to write one myself.
