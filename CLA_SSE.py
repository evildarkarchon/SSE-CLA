		First and foremost, try to close any other application and background processes that might be running that you do not need.
		Like, but not limited to, game launchers, web browsers with 20 open tabs, Spotify, even Discord.
		Also, you might want to consider using lower texture mods, aka, use a 2k instead of a 4k texture mod, or just a 1k texture.

		If the above did not help, you could try apply these config tweaks to: __Skyrim.ini___
		Make sure to comment out (#) any existing variants of these, so you can go back if they dont help or make things worse.

		This is most applicable if you're using 4-8 GB ram or less, you game addicted freak! ;) (said the guy who was playing WoW raids at 3 fps).

		==================================

		Last but not least, increasing your pagefile is a good and simple way to avoid this.
		Best practice: pagefile-size > RAM
		Example: 24 GB > 16 GB RAM

		Please read / follow:
		1. In the Taskbar Search, type “Advanced System“. ...
		2. In System Properties, click Advanced tab.
		3. In Performance section click Settings button.
		4. Performance Options will open. ...
		5. Here, under Virtual memory, select Change.
		6. Uncheck Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.
		7. Select a Drive that hardly use (as in not often)
		8. Set manual size
		9. Set value to ~ 150% of your RAM (as shown in example)
		10. Confirm with "OK".
